# Classroom Attendance Tracker Use Case

## About
The School of Legends is now a full-time education sector focusing on helping young individuals make their way into a low-code career while still primarily focusing on an appropriate student curriculum. Students now attend the School of Legends to learn low-code development while being taught their required subjects that they would have in any other school.


## Use Case
Student attendance is low because the school is relatively new. The principal would like to gain clarity on student attendance per subject and per grade. This will help the program identify subjects that students don’t enjoy, which students come late, and various other factors.

In order to make these decisions, each teacher will need to complete an attendance form at the beginning of each lesson. Teachers should be able to mark students as Attended, Late or Absent. At the end of each month, the principal will need to review student attendance across all the grades, subjects, and teachers to keep track of how everything is going. If a student achieves a 90% on-time attendance score at the end of the month, their name should have a little gold star to highlight their achievement.

The school needs a simple solution that allows teachers to select the class they are teaching and view all the students in that class. They will then need to mark students’ attendance accordingly. The principal needs to be able to view all the results on a monthly basis and should be the only user with access to make changes to past attendance registers.
