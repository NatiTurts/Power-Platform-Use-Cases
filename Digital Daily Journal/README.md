# Digital Daily Journal Use Case

## About
Your friend recently recommended that writing down your day in a journal every night helps prevent stress and is great for your mental health. They mentioned that there were so many paid-for digital journal apps out there, but spending that amount of money is not in their budget. As a Power Platform developer, you are confident that you can create a digital journal for them and can also include features they would really like.


## Use Case
After chatting with your friend, you took the initiative to review the multiple digital journals available. The plan was to gather features from all the other products you felt would benefit them. At the same time, you had some great feature ideas you saw were not really available and wanted to include them in your version. Being that your friend is a very busy person, thereâ€™s always the possibility they might forget to jot down their day. A nightly reminder would be really neat.


## Requirements
### User Stories
1. Their journal is private, so it definitely needs to be password-protected.
2. Your friend should be able to reset their password outside and within the app.
3. The app needs a user-friendly UI/UX that makes it easy to record journals.
4. The solution should accommodate rich text input, photo uploads, and audio recordings.
5. When creating a journal, your friend should be able to rate their emotions for that day.
6. Your friend would like to see a calendar representing each day's emotion rating.
7. If your friend has not logged a journal by 8 p.m., they should be reminded to create one by means of any appropriate notification method.
8. Your friend should be able to view all previous journals they have logged and also be able to edit them.
