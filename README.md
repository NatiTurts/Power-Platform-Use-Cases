Having been on both the giving and receiving ends of interviews, I always felt that having something to showcase your skills was incredibly beneficial.

As I journey along my Power Platform Career, I continue to build my portfolio of solutions. This allows me to expand my skillset, experiment with features, and open myself up to creative freedom to build solutions I feel are awesome. Having this portfolio by my side grows my confidence as a developer and allows me to showcase my work without having to worry about data confidentiality issues. This is now my work.

Trying to find ideas for solutions to add to your portfolio can be daunting at times. Thatâ€™s why I have put together a few Use Cases that you may find useful. Not only does tackling these use cases allow you to build solutions to fill your portfolio, but it is also a fantastic way to prepare for potential interviews and gives you something to show off.

Each use case will give you a fantasy background, a problem statement, requirements, user stories, and dummy datasets. There is no wrong or right way. It's an opportunity to paint a blank canvas and use your imagination to come up with some really cool solutions.

I highly recommend that when you do build these solutions, you do so in your own tenant. If you don't have your own personal tenant, you can sign up for a Microsoft Developer Plan [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) and renew it every 90 days.

If you enjoy these use cases and have some of your own you would like to see on here, send me a mail at usecase@nati-turtledove.com.
