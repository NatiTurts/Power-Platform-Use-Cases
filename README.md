# Power Platform Use Cases
Trying to find ideas for solutions to add to your portfolio can be daunting at times. Thatâ€™s why I have put together a few Use Cases that you may find useful. Not only does tackling these use cases allow you to build solutions to fill your portfolio, but it is also a great way to prep for potential interviews and gives you something to show off. 
If you enjoyed these uses cases and have some of your own you would like to see on here, pop me a mail at usecase@nati-turtledove.com
